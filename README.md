# Zian Khan

<p>I am currently pursuing my Computer Science degree at Queens College and plan on graduating in Fall 2021. After graduating, I plan to display my leadership, analytical, 
and coding skills in the working field to fuel the already rapidly-growing industry of technology. I also aim to grow my network while leaning more about software development 
so that I can make an impact in the areas that I can.</p>

<p>In addition to pursuing my degree, I also take the time to increase my knowledge on financial literacy such as avoiding/handling debt, investing in both the long and short
term and learning about money as a whole. I also love engaging in playing and watching basketball. Aside from playing in private leagues/tournaments I also trade NBA NFT's in
my free time.</p>
