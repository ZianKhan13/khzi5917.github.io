          <h1>Zian Khan</h1>
          <h2>Computer Science Student at Queens College</h2>

          <p>I am currently pursuing my Computer Science degree at Queens College and plan on graduating in Fall 2021.
            After graduating, I plan to display my leadership, analytical, and coding skills in the working field to
            fuel the already rapidly-growing industry of technology. I also aim to grow my network while leaning more
            about software development so that I can make an impact in the areas that I can.</p>
          <p>In addition to pursuing my degree, I also take the time to increase my knowledge on financial literacy
            such as avoiding/handling debt, investing in both the long and short term and learning about money as a whole.
            I also love engaging in playing and watching basketball. Aside from playing in private leagues/tournaments
            I also trade NBA NFT's in my free time.</p>
